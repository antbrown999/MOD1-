        <h1>My name is Antonio Brown,</h1>

    
        <h2>I am a new Frontend Web Developer. I have experience in Html, CSS, and Javascript.</h2>
    
        <p><h3 style="color: rgb(152, 152, 30);">Hello! I’m a beginning software developer with a strong foundation in programming principles, a genuine curiosity for problem-solving, and a relentless drive to grow my skills. While I’m early in my career, I bring a unique edge: a deep commitment to lifelong learning, paired with hands-on experience through projects that showcase my adaptability and technical abilities.</h3></p>

            <p><h3 style="color: green;">What sets me apart is my dedication to building well-thought-out, efficient code and my focus on understanding the “why” behind each solution. I’m not just learning syntax or frameworks; I’m actively developing my problem-solving mindset and striving to improve how I analyze and design solutions. Through continuous education, open-source contributions, and collaboration on small projects, I’m sharpening my skills to keep up with the fast pace of the industry.</h3></p>
            
            <p><h3 style="color:blue;">Additionally, I’m proactive and resourceful—qualities that drive me to find creative solutions to problems and to leverage available tools and documentation to learn independently. This mindset not only makes me capable of tackling challenges, but it also prepares me to collaborate effectively and keep improving as a developer.
            </h3></p>
